# Twitter_Hashtags_Geoplotting_MongoDB
Analysed the data collected from Twitter of 10k tweets each for Delhi Smog and Ockhi Cyclone and stored them in MongoDB. 

Extracted and analysed locations of the tweets and plotted them using Google charts. 

Evaluated tweets of non-Delhi and non-Mumbai locations and tried to find the top 10 hashtags used.

To be done:

1.Distribution of Original Tweets vs Retweeted Tweets

2.Distribution of favorite counts on Original Tweets

3.Distribution of Type of Tweet i.e. Text, Image, Text+Image
